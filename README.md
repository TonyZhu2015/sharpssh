#SharpSSH - A Secure Shell (SSH) library for .NET

This is a port of Tamir Gals .Net SSH Client with streaming opened up.

SharpSSH is a pure .NET implementation of the SSH2 client protocol suite. It provides an API for communication with SSH servers and can be integrated into any .NET application.
The library is a C# port of the JSch project from JCraft Inc. and is released under [BSD style license](http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/LICENSE.txt).

SharpSSH allows you to read/write data and transfer files over SSH channels using an API similar to JSch's API. In addition, it provides some additional wrapper classes which offer even simpler abstraction for SSH communication.
SharpSSH is hosted on sourceforge, please check out its project page.
